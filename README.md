# hps-submarine-architecture

Hello guys! This is the architecture for the submarine problem!

At the current moment, there are three `.py` files:
* run_game.py: simulates a complete run of the game
* submarine_server.py: the server-side code for the game- DO NOT TOUCH THIS FILE
* submarine_clients_template.py: a sample of the two client-side agents: the submarine captain and the trench manager

I will update this README as the architecture finalizes
